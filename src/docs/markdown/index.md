## Alpha version notice

**Timelinize is unfinished software.** New versions may not be backwards-compatible, so expect that you will have to reset with new timelines when you upgrade. Thank you for being an early tester!

## Get started

Start by [preparing your data](/docs/data-preparation) for import, then [install](/docs/install) the application.
