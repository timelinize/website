Telegram
========

A record of conversations had via Telegram.


How to get it
-------------

On Telegram Desktop:

1. Go to _Settings -> Advanced -> Export Telegram Data_ (way at the bottom).
2. Be sure to select _Machine-readable JSON_ at the very bottom.
3. Checking all the other boxes is recommended; but at least make sure the following are selected:
	- Account information
	- Contacts list
	- Personal chats


Expected format
---------------

(TODO: Basically just the export as-is.)


What is imported
----------------

Currently, only 1-1 chats are supported. Support for group chats is planned.
