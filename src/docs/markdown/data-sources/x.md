X (Twitter)
===========

A copy of your account data from X (formerly Twitter).

How to get it
-------------

1. In _Settings and privacy_, go to [Download your data](https://x.com/settings/download_your_data).
2. Click _Request archive_ (you may have to verify your login first).
3. Wait for the archive to be available, then download it. It may take several days.


Expected format
---------------

The downloaded archive can be imported as-is; or you may extract it first.


What is imported
----------------

- Posts (formerly tweets)
- Uploaded media
- Direct messages


Notes
-----

X's data archive does not include any usernames or display names of any other users, so when importing DMs, many unnamed entities with only a X account ID will be created.

The archive does it contain the contents of quoted posts.
